The famous statement \"people who bought this also bought something else\". This is what is done in the **recommendation systems** like Amazon, Netflix, Spotify etc. The recommendation systems **recommend/predict** what customers will buy/watch/listen based on **prior** knowledge of what they bought/watched/listned before. In this part we will learn how to make model of recommendation systems.\n","\n","The Association Rule Learning is very different from what we learned before where we were predicting dependent variable and we knew what to predict (supervised learning: regression and classification), we also did clustering where we learnd some patterns in the data so as to create a new dependent variable (unsupervised learning) and now we will learn association rules inside an ensemble of movies/transations/songs. This is very important for retail or e-commerce companies.\n","\n","There are two models **Apriori** and **Eclat** we will learn under Association Rule Learning (Apriori is better)."],"metadata":{"id":"qa_ZE2jqsPDl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eiNwni1xsEgT"},"source":["## Importing the libraries"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The `scikit-learn` library does not include the **Apriori model**, so we will use another library `apyori` (**apyori.py** is a Python implementation containing all the algorithms of the Apriori model).
