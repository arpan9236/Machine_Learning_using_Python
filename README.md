Here, I have built and trained various Machine Learning (ML) models which I have learnt from Udemy ML course (Course name: Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024]. Instructors: Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves). 

Here you will find how to do 

(1) **Data Preprocessing**, 

and build and train following ML models on various datasets to solve very interesting business problems. 

(2) **Regression models**(Supervised Learning): Simple linear regression, Multiple linear regression, Polynomial linear regression, Support vector regression, Decision tree regression, and Random forest regression. I also did Model evaluation and compared these models and shown how to choose the best regression model based on some metrics.

(3) **Classification models** (Supervised Learning): Logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, Support vector machine (SVM), kernel-SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision tree classification, Random forest classification, Classification model selection, Evaluating classification models using some metrics. 

(4) **Unsupervised learning**: K-Means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, 

(5) **Association Rule Learning**: Apriori and Eclat models, 

(6) **Reinforcement Learning**: Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson sampling,

to solve various business problems and case studies. 

I have completed the course upto this portion. Currently, I am learning Ntural Language Processing (NLP) and other advanced ML models. I will update the codes of these topics as I finish learning.
